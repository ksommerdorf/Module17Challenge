# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview of Project
Fast Lending is a peer to peer leading services company who is looking to utilize machine learnig to predict credit risk. The goal is to provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience and to lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans outweighs risky loans. Therefore this project employs different supervised machine learnig techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes using python libraries, imablanced-learn and scikit-learn. The models
